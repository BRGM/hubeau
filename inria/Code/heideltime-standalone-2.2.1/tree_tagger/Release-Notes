new in version 3.2.4:

The lemma of unknown words is guessed with a simple heuristic:
If the unknown word is "Computerbildschirms" and "Bildschirms"
is contained in the lexicon with the same tag, then the lemma
is guessed by concatenating "Computer" and the lemma of "Bildschirms".

new in version 3.2.3:

Cardinal numbers may now contain the characters + and '.

new in version 3.2.2:

There is no longer an option "-cap-heuristics" because this option has
been modified and turned into the default behaviour of the tagger.
